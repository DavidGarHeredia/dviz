# dviz

Software to visualize classic problems in Operations Research.

## Why?

Visualization is a crucial part in any Operations Research Project. If done 
correctly it helps to: 
- Understand the problem to new developers joining the project. 
- Check faster if the solution generated makes sense or there is any bug (regarding 
feasibility or optimality).
- Convey results to stakeholders.

As with any software product, in an Operations Research project there is 
a lot of work to do besides the pure mathematical optimization part. This project 
aims to ease the burden of the visualization one :)

### Problems supported

At the moment:
- Machine-like scheduling problems.
